<i><u><h1>Shiva.. The Lord</h1></u></i>
<i><h2>Mahadev...</h2></i>
<i><h3>shankar...</h3></i>
<i><p>Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in Hinduism, is revered as the supreme being who embodies both creation and destruction, symbolizing the cyclical nature of existence. Often depicted with a third eye, a serpent around his neck, and a crescent moon adorning his hair, Shiva is known for his ascetic lifestyle and deep meditation. His abode is Mount Kailash, where he resides with his consort Parvati and their children Ganesha and Kartikeya. Shiva is associated with various attributes, including Nataraja, the cosmic dancer, and Ardhanarishvara, representing the union of masculine and feminine energies.<br /> Devotees worship Shiva for his role as the destroyer of ignorance and the transformer of the universe, believing that through destruction, new creation emerges. The significance of Lord Shiva extends beyond religious boundaries.
